Reddit, the self-proclaimed ``frontpage of the internet'', is a website
containing entirely user-contributed, uncurated content organized by topic. Over
the past few years, Reddit has gained prominence within popular media channels
for various reasons, all surrounding the content submitted by Reddit users, or
Redditors.

Redditors can be extremely engaged and reliable, and therefore useful as
sensors. In this paper, we develop a method of determining if Redditors are
reliable based on their post and comment history, as well as the reaction of the
community to their activity. Furthermore, the resulting analysis can be used to
create a predictor of future Redditor activity. For example, this would allow
for the creation of nudges to encourage users who demonstrate potential
dependability to turn them into actual, reliable users - and conversely,
discourage unreliable users from posting on Reddit, increasing the net
dependability of the site.
