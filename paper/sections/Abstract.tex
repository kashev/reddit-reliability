In this paper, we present a system by which to evaluate the reliability of the
users of the popular social network \reddit{}. In the past, \reddit{} has had
numerous identity issues. However, through the efforts of both \reddit{} and the
userbase itself, it is becoming a place where users come to read and discuss
news. Thus, there is a growing need to evaluate the reliability of the suppliers
of information on \reddit{}. We first collect features of both reliable and
unreliable users based on their contributions, and most importantly, the
reaction of the community to their contributions. We then use machine learning
techniques to train a regression model to assign a reliability score to an
arbitrary reddit user.
