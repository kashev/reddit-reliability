In this paper, we present a system by which to evaluate the reliability of the
users of the popular social network Reddit. Though Reddit is many things to many
people, increasingly, through the efforts of both the company running Reddit and
the userbase itself, it is becoming a place where users come to read and discuss
news. Thus, there is a growing need to evaluate the realibility of the suppliers
of information on Reddit. We first collect features of reliable and unreliable
users based on their contributions, and importantly, the reaction of the
community to their contributions. We then use machine learning techniques to
train a regression model to give a reliability score to an arbitrary user, with
promising results.
