From our trained random forest regression model, we get a picture of the way
that Redditors are. We get a glimpse of what useful, contributing Redditors look
like, and what bad, non-contributing Redditors look like.

We collected data on around two thousand Redditors, and ran their data through
our regressive model to get a reliability score $-1 \leq s_r \leq 1$. Then, we
re-correlate this score with input features to intuitively see what features are
important or not, and what features indicated useful and not-useful Redditors.
