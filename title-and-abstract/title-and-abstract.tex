\begin{abstract}
Reddit, the self-proclaimed ``frontpage of the internet'', is a website
containing entirely user-contributed, uncurated content organized by topic. Over
the past few years, Reddit has gained prominence within popular media channels
for various reasons, all surrounding the content submitted by Reddit users, or
Redditors.
\newline

Redditors can be extremely engaged and reliable, and therefore useful as
sensors. In this paper, we develop a method of determining if Redditors are
reliable based on their post and comment history, as well as the reaction of the
community to their activity. Furthermore, we use this data to create a predictor
of future Redditor activity, allowing for the creation of nudges to encourage
users who demonstrate potential reliability to turn them into actual, reliable
users.  Similarly, users who are not reliable can be discouraged from posting on
Reddit, increasing the net reliability of the site.
