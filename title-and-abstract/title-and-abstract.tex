\begin{abstract}
Reddit is emerging as an increasingly popular, and thus important, social
network. Reddit users, or Redditors, can be extremely engaged and reliable, and
therefore useful as sensors. In this papers, we develop a method of determining
if Reddit users are reliable based on their post and comment history, as well as
the reaction of the community to their activity. Furthermore, we use this
Redditor data to create an accurate predictor of future Redditor activity. Users
exhibiting signs of future reliable sources can then be encouraged on the
behaviors that turn them into reliable users. Similarly, users who are not
reliable can be discouraged from posting.
