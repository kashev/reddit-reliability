\section{Summary}
This paper talked about the relevance of the Instagram in the context of social sensing. Given the context of the instagram as a new technology there exists great potential for it to be used as a sensing medium where, previously, no such thing existed. They explore the metadata associated with the information presented that was not previously available. This was more of a passive act leading to decreased friction in data generation. Because humans don't touch the data, odds are, that the data is more valid than conscious user generated data. 

\section{Critique}

- English, do you speak it? \\
- Paper without a purpose. \\
- Inconsistent terminology quadrants -> sectors \\
- Stating the obvious \\

\section{Praise}
- Good job exploring a new medium for social sensing. Set the ground work for future papers.
